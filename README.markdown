Sebastian's Coding Standard for PHP_CodeSniffer
===============================================

This is the set of sniffs that I use with [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) for my projects.


Installation
------------

* Install [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) with `pear install PHP_CodeSniffer` (PHP_CodeSniffer 1.3 or later is required).
* Checkout this repository as `Sebastian` into the `PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards` directory.
* Use the coding standard with `phpcs --standard=Sebastian`.
